Here you can see some of the projects I have been working on, and indirectly, my interests and some of my experience.

### Project 1 - Census in jail: characterization of People deprieved of liberty

This is a very special project for me because I have been part of all of its stages:

#### 1. Preparing the recollection of data
My university in coordination with the Program in charge of Metropolitan jails from Uruguay gave alumni the oportunity to be part of the collecting of social and educational information about people deprieved of their liberty.

Alumni who was on board of this program (including me), first had to study jail conditions, legal system in Uruguay, theory about education, crime and family in order to give shape to the census and have a clear picture of what information do we needed and how to collect it.

#### 2. Collecting the data

We were also in charge of asking all the questions to the people deprieved of their liberty in jail and we were able to cense all of the jail population (561 people).
